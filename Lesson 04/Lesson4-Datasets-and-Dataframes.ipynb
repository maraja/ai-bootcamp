    "**Background:** For this boot camp, we will be scraping data from data-sets into data-frames using the ‘pandas’ library. Data scraping is about obtaining data from webpages or other data-sets. There is low level scraping where you parse data out of the HTML or XML code of a webpage. You can also scrape data from the APIs of certain websites as well as pre-compiled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminders:**\n",
    "-\tMake use of short-cuts, like tab completion\n",
    "-\tMake use of Google; Resources can help you turn snippets into fully             functional code\n",
    "-\tMake variable names meaningful!!!\n",
    "    - (a = b * c) can be harder to interpret when contextual errors arise\n",
    "    - Using contextually relevant variable names can make it easier for \n",
    "      others to jump in and contribute to, or analyze your code when you get stuck\n",
    "- **Comment your code for clear logic!**\n",
