    "### Gradient descent for neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying gradient descent to our neural network is somewhat more involved in terms of the calculus required but the basic principles are the same. We have a loss function defined and the parameters of this function are the weights and biases of our neural network. So we need to find the weights of our neural network such that the value of our loss function is minimized. Just like we did in the simple example above what we have to do now is take the gradient of our loss function with respect to our parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four derivatives we need to compute: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(2)}}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b^{(2)}}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b}$. These have the following formulae:\n",

    "This is the derivative of our loss function with respect to our second set of weights, the ones corresponding to the hidden to output connections. On the right hand side we see it expressed via the chain rule. We will denote the first derivative in the chain as $\\delta^{(2)} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Z^{(2)}}$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So what about that $\\delta^{(2)}$ You can think of it as the \"error\" of the nodes in its layer (our output layer in this case). Denoting that derivative as $\\delta^{(2)}$ is also useful because it allows us to express derivatives across layers in a recursive fashion. We will this in action later. Andrew Ng's famous coursera course is a great resource on how this works. I will link further resources regarding these derivations at the end of this section but for now let's just see the math formulas we have to implement in code.\n",
